  SMART:
    name: SMART
    long_name: Spectral Modular Airborne Radiation measurement sysTem
    kind: [solar spectrometer]
    description: Modular system to measure spectral solar radiation (irradiance, radiance) from airborne platforms. Measurements cover a spectral range between 300 and 2200 nm. Includes an active attitude correction of the optical inlets to compensate for aircraft movements.

  VELOX:
    name: VELOX
    long_name: Video airbornE Longwave Observations within siX channels
    kind: [thermal infrared spectral imager]
    description: VELOX327k veL spectral imager (640 by 512 pixels) with a synchronized filter wheel (at 100 Hz) covering up to six spectral channels (based on application) in the thermal infrared wavelength range from 7.7 to 12.0 micrometer. It measures the brightness temperature or upward radiance of surfaces and cloud tops. The instruments field-of-view is 35.49° by 28.71°. The istrument ist extended by a KT19.85 II infrared thermometer and installed in a temperature and presure controlled housing within the belly pod of HALO.
